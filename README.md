Step 0: Application feature functionality 
Orchestrate the technology stack architecture that ingest image and compile execution command to caption‚Äìget captioning with the ‚Äúgpt-4-vision-preview‚Äù model; then chunk caption text context and embed text as vector index through the chain of thought architecture. Outline and orchestrate the capability architecture for application that caption context from image and parse RAG chunk vector  as chatbot conversation completion. Embrace the Large Action/Agentic Model  for the command execution for the algorithmically augmented underwriting and prevention nudged behavior.

Step 1: ingest image using Gradio user interface & computer vision model = gpt-4-vision-preview as command function for the image caption
Create a GradioUI for users to upload images through a web link. Process the image conversion, compression or other adjustments needed like resizing, using base64 as encoder-decoder to image bytes for the computer vision model = gpt-4-vision-preview that caption image and call the OpenAI API endpoint for the model = gpt-4-vision-preview
